/**
 * This is the module descriptor and entry point for your module in the runtime.
 * The unique name of the moduel is the name of the directory on the modules folder.
 * A BoxLang mapping will be created for you with the name of the module.
 *
 * A module can have the following folders that will be automatically registered:
 * + bifs - Custom BIFs that will be registered into the runtime
 * + interceptors - Custom interceptors that will be registered into the runtime via the configure() method
 * + libs - Custom java libraries that your module leverages
 * + tags - Custom tags that will be registered into the runtime
 *
 * Every module will have its own classloader that will be used to load the module libs and dependencies.
